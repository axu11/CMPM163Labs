Lab 6
Part 1

Spotlight: Points in a direction based on their transform's rotation and 
	illuminates all objects within a cone, responding to both 
	position and rotation. 

Directional Light: Affects all objects in the scene, lighting them based 
	on the direction of the light set by the game object's rotation. 
	Position in the scene is irrelevant.

Point Light: Illuminates objects in the scene based on the light's 
	position in the scene. Rotation has no influence on the light as 
	this light shines equally in all directions.

Area Light: Only works when baking a light map. Shines in all directions 
	to one side of a rectangular plane.

I made this rug material by using normal and texture maps of a rug that 
I found online. It looks a lot like the rug in my room. I adjusted the 
tiling so that the texturing would be more visible. I used this rug 
material to make a rug in my scene.

For textures, I added a fir tree mesh and a poplar tree mesh, and applied
tree textures onto them. These were all found on the Unity Asset Store.

The skybox is a dim sunset that I found on the Unity Asset Store.
