I made my scene by adding trees and rocks that I found from the Unity Asset Store. I placed a 
large plane beneath my mountains as a ground, and placed two cubes by the edges of the mountains
so that it wouldn't look like they were floating. I made my water wave thinner and longer to look
like a stream running through the scene. I also have a floating sphere with the mountain shader
applied to it because I thought it looked cool.

We did not help each other with any part of the lab.
