As I was doing the tutorial, I already knew I wanted to create a 
rural village rather than a modern urban city. After I finished 
the tutorial, I tried looking at villages from The Witcher to 
get inspiration from. The villages I found influenced me to add
more villagey things, such as wells and fences, as well 
as environmental features like rivers and trees.

My partner made his city by adding an extra loop in the code to 
stack the buildings on top of each other, turning them into tall 
skyscrapers. He also added empty space to create a sort of
enclosed space , protected by the skyscrapers. I thought this
was an interesting approach.

We did not help each other on the lab.
