As I was doing the tutorial, I already knew I wanted to create a 
rural village rather than a modern urban city. After I finished 
the tutorial, I tried looking at villages from The Witcher to 
get inspiration from. The villages I found influenced me to add
more villagey things, such as wells and fences, as well 
as environmental features like rivers and trees.

We did not help each other on the lab.
