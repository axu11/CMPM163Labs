For the first cube on the left I changed the color between blue and pink using my own shader.
For the second cube I used a Phong material with green specular highlight from Three.js.
For the third cube I interpolated between lime and pink using the given fragment shader.
For the final cube on the right I used a Normal material from Three.js.
