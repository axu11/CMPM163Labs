Moved pieces of the track around in order to incorporate a U-bank and spiral ramps, 
as well as adjusting the checkpoint positions accordingly.

For the particle system, I made it green and made the particles move faster at the 
cost of a shorter lifespan, as well as changing their shape and trajectory by 
playing with angles.
